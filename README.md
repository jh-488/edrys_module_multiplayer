# Edrys_Module_Multiplayer

This is a Multiplayer Tab that can be added to an Edrys classroom. It communicates with the [Code Editor](https://github.com/jh-488/Edrys_Code_Editor). 

Users can create or join rooms, where they can play against each other. Each player gets a limited time to solve the challenge, whoever solves it first wins.

Use this URL to add the module to your class:
